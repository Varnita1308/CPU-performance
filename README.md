# CPU-performance
CPU performance project

1. C++ code to test CPU performance using Atomic and Mutex operations.

2. Java Project to test CPU performance using Thread affinity, Thread class and Thread priority.
  Threads.java : main class
  ThreadIO.java : java class for IO intensive threads
  ThreadComp.java : java class for computation intensive threads
  Thread11.java : class for thread operations of 2 instances of ThreadIO
  Thread22.java :  class for thread operations of 2 instances of ThreadComp
  Thread12.java : class for thread operations of 1 instance of ThreadIO and 1 instance of ThreadComp
  InfThreadAffinity : Interface is created to implement all Thread affinity operations
  InfThreadPriority : Interface is created to implement all Thread priority operations
